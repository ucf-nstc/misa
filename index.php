		<p class="col-md-6">The materials innovation for sustainable agriculture (MISA) is a center of excellence that has been established to carry out research and education/extension on material innovation to tackle agricultural/citrus diseases. Our program originated from a partnership between US universities, grower cooperatives, agri-chemical industries, regulatory agencies supported through several funded projects from USDA.-NIFA, Citrus Research and Development Foundation, and industry.</p>

		<p class="col-md-6">While it is physically located at the University of Central Florida (UCF), at the heart of Central Florida, we intend for MISA to become a platform for scientists, grower, and industry to meet and exchange the knowledge and skills available to combat agricultural diseases for long-term crop protection.
